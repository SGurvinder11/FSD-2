1. AIM
To design an interactive login form using Material UI components in React and implement client-side form validation to ensure correct user input before submission.

2. THEORY
Forms are used to collect data from users such as email, password, and other inputs.
In React, forms are usually implemented using controlled components, where form values are managed using component state.
Validation is an important step to ensure that the entered data is correct before submitting the form. It helps prevent invalid inputs such as incorrect email formats or weak passwords.
Material UI (MUI) is a popular React UI library that provides ready-made components like TextField, Button, and Container, which help in creating responsive and professional-looking forms with minimal code.

3. COMMANDS USED

npm create vite@latest exp6-forms -- --template react
cd exp6-forms
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm run dev

4. STEPS / PROCEDURE
Create a new React project using Vite.
Install Material UI and required dependencies.
Create a login form using TextField and Button components.
Use useState to store form values and validation errors.
Implement validation logic for email and password fields.
Display error messages using helperText.
Submit the form only when validation is successful.

5. LEARNING OUTCOMES
After completing this experiment, the student will be able to:
Understand and implement controlled components in React
Use Material UI form components effectively
Apply client-side validation logic
Display error messages using helperText
Handle form submission in React applications
